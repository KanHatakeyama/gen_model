# Generative model for material property prediction

# About
- Codes are related to an article: A Generative Model for Extrapolation Prediction in Materials Informatics
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00157
- Predict versatile molecular properties using a generative model
- The model is robust against missing data, which will be imputed by the model.
- Better performances are obtained with extrapolating tasks than conventional models.
